   Abstract={Genome-wide association studies have identified dozens of loci associated with risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, identifying the causal variants and their functional role in the appropriate cell type remains a major challenge; the latter in particular because of the dearth of regulatory profiling in human lung cells. We generated ATAC-seq data for four primary lung cell types implicated in disease pathology: alveolar type II (AT-II), bronchial epithelial (NHBE), small airway epithelial (SAEC), and lung fibroblast (LF) cells, as well as the 16HBE human bronchial epithelial cell line. We used these profiles to evaluate the overlap and enrichment of COPD risk variants in lung-specific open chromatin regions (OCRs). Leveraging additional chromatin accessibility data from ENCODE, we generated cell type-specific regulatory sequence vocabularies using the machine-learning algorithm gkmSVM and predicted the effect of >6,500 potential COPD risk variants corresponding to 82 COPD loci in the five lung cell types. We observed that although statistical fine-mapping alone could not resolve the causal variants at most COPD loci, integration of the lung cell specific chromatin accessibility profiles identified hundreds of COPD risk variants with putative cell-specific functional effects. We further compared the functional consequences of COPD variants in a diversity of cell types and tissues from ENCODE and observed that many variants with the largest predicted effect sizes were not cell type specific. Correlation and clustering of the samples revealed cell-specific patterns of variant effects, suggesting distinct regulatory consequences of COPD genetic risk factors in lung epithelium, endothelial, and immune cells. By profiling genomic regulatory regions in specific lung cell populations and generating cell-type-specific models of functional variation, this work identified numerous putative causal variants for COPD risk beyond GWAS and fine-mapping approaches and highlights the importance of cell-specific regulatory profiling to predict the molecular effects of risk variants in disease.}

   Abstract={Rationale: rs2076295, a top SNP at chromosome 6p24 associated with IPF disease, is an eQTL SNP for DSP expression in lung tissues. We hypothesized rs2076295 is the functional variant regulating DSP expression in human bronchial epithelial cells, and DSP determines IPF susceptibility by mediating expression of extracellular matrix (ECM)-related genes and regulating cell migration. Objective: To determine whether rs2076295 regulates DSP, and the function of DSP in airway epithelial cells. Methods: Using CRISPR/Cas9 editing (including regional deletion, indel, CRISPRi and single-base editing), we modified SNP rs2076295 and measured DSP expression in 16HBE14o- cells and primary human bronchial epithelial cells. Localization of DSP was assessed by immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry staining in human lung tissue and epithelial cells culture at air liquid interface. Cellular transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), proliferation, cell death, migration and genome-wide gene expression changes were examined in 16HBE14o- single colonies with DSP knockout generated by CRISPR/Cas-9 method. Measurements and Main Results: In human lung, DSP is expressed predominantly in bronchial epithelial cells and alveolar epithelial cells. Deletion of the DNA regions spanning rs2076295 reduced DSP expression. Knockout of DSP in 16HBE14o- cells moderately decreased TEER but increased cell migration rate. RNA-seq analysis demonstrated increased expression of ECM (such as MFAP2, MMP-7, MMP-9, COL6A3) genes in DSP knockout clones and silencing of MMP-7 and MMP-9 reversed increased cell migration in DSP knockout cells. Conclusions: The IPF SNP rs2076295 regulates DSP expression in human lung epithelial cells. DSP modulates ECM genes and cell migration, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of IPF.}

   Abstract={Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Present-day diagnostic criteria are largely based solely on spirometric criteria. Accumulating evidence has identified a substantial number of individuals without spirometric evidence of COPD who suffer from respiratory symptoms and/or increased morbidity and mortality. There is a clear need for an expanded definition of COPD that is linked to physiologic, structural (computed tomography [CT]) and clinical evidence of disease. Using data from the COPD Genetic Epidemiology study (COPDGene®), we hypothesized that an integrated approach that includes environmental exposure, clinical symptoms, chest CT imaging and spirometry better defines disease and captures the likelihood of progression of respiratory obstruction and mortality.\\ Four key disease characteristics - environmental exposure (cigarette smoking), clinical symptoms (dyspnea and/or chronic bronchitis), chest CT imaging abnormalities (emphysema, gas trapping and/or airway wall thickening), and abnormal spirometry - were evaluated in a group of 8784 current and former smokers who were participants in COPDGene® Phase 1. Using these 4 disease characteristics, 8 categories of participants were identified and evaluated for odds of spirometric disease progression (FEV1 > 350 ml loss over 5 years), and the hazard ratio for all-cause mortality was examined.\\ Using smokers without symptoms, CT imaging abnormalities or airflow obstruction as the reference population, individuals were classified as Possible COPD, Probable COPD and Definite COPD. Current Global initiative for obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) criteria would diagnose 4062 (46%) of the 8784 study participants with COPD. The proposed COPDGene® 2019 diagnostic criteria would add an additional 3144 participants. Under the new criteria, 82% of the 8784 study participants would be diagnosed with Possible, Probable or Definite COPD. These COPD groups showed increased risk of disease progression and mortality. Mortality increased in patients as the number of their COPD characteristics increased, with a maximum hazard ratio for all cause-mortality of 5.18 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.15-6.48) in those with all 4 disease characteristics.\\ A substantial portion of smokers with respiratory symptoms and imaging abnormalities do not manifest spirometric obstruction as defined by population normals. These individuals are at significant risk of death and spirometric disease progression. We propose to redefine the diagnosis of COPD through an integrated approach using environmental exposure, clinical symptoms, CT imaging and spirometric criteria. These expanded criteria offer the potential to stimulate both current and future interventions that could slow or halt disease progression in patients before disability or irreversible lung structural changes develop.},

   Abstract={Parametric response mapping (PRM) of paired lung computed tomography (CT) scans has improved assessment and characterization of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), allowing for the quantification of two distinct components that contribute to airflow obstruction: emphysema and functional small airway disease (fSAD). Previously, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of quantitative imaging phenotypes have identified genetic variants associated with emphysema and gas trapping, several of which are also associated with COPD susceptibility and lung function levels. We hypothesized that the improved quantitative resolution of PRM would reveal novel genetic association signals distinct to each phenotypic component.}

   Abstract={Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common and progressive disease that is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. For many years, knowledge of the genetic basis of COPD was limited to Mendelian syndromes, such as alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency and cutis laxa, caused by rare genetic variants. Over the past decade, the proliferation of genome-wide association studies, the accessibility of whole-genome sequencing, and the development of novel methods for analyzing genetic variation data have led to a substantial increase in the understanding of genetic variants that play a role in COPD susceptibility and COPD-related phenotypes. COPDGene (Genetic Epidemiology of COPD), a multicenter, longitudinal study of over 10,000 current and former cigarette smokers, has been pivotal to these breakthroughs in understanding the genetic basis of COPD. To date, over 20 genetic loci have been convincingly associated with COPD affection status, with additional loci demonstrating association with COPD-related phenotypes such as emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and hypoxemia. In this review, we discuss the contributions of the COPDGene study to the discovery of these genetic associations as well as the ongoing genetic investigations of COPD subtypes, protein biomarkers, and post-genome-wide association study analysis.},

   Abstract={Calcineurin inhibitors induce nephrotoxicity through poorly understood mechanisms thereby limiting their use in transplantation and other diseases. Here we define a microRNA (miRNA)-messenger RNA (mRNA) interaction map that facilitates exploration into the role of miRNAs in cyclosporine-induced nephrotoxicity (CIN) and the gene pathways they regulate. Using photoactivatable ribonucleoside-enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP), we isolated RNAs associated with Argonaute 2 in the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) of cyclosporine A (CsA) treated and control human proximal tubule cells and identified mRNAs undergoing active targeting by miRNAs. CsA causes specific changes in miRNAs and mRNAs associated with RISC, thereby altering post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Pathway enrichment analysis identified canonical pathways regulated by miRNAs specifically following CsA treatment. RNA-seq performed on total RNA indicated that only a fraction of total miRNAs and mRNAs are actively targeted in the RISC, indicating that PAR-CLIP more accurately defines meaningful targeting interactions. Our data also revealed a role for miRNAs in calcineurin-independent regulation of JNK and p38 MAPKs caused by targeting of MAP3K1. Together, our data provide a novel resource and unique insights into molecular pathways regulated by miRNAs in CIN. The gene pathways and miRNAs defined may represent novel targets to reduce calcineurin induced nephrotoxicity.},

   Abstract={A major complication associated with cyclosporine (CsA) treatment is nephrotoxicity. In this study, we examined whether microRNAs play a role in cyclosporine-induced nephrotoxicity. Treatment of mice with CsA resulted in nephrotoxicity that was associated with an early increase in expression of microRNA mmu-miR-494 (miR-494). Similarly, tubular epithelial cell epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) induced by CsA toxicity resulted in the upregulation of microRNA-494 and a decrease in PTEN levels in vitro. miR-494 directly targeted Pten and negatively regulated its expression. Preventing Pten targeting by miR-494 was sufficient to prevent CsA induced EMT. Knockdown of miR-494 prevented the downregulation of PTEN in tubular epithelial cells following CsA treatment and also prevented CsA induced EMT. Thus, miR-494 plays a major role in promoting CsA induced nephrotoxicity through its ability to target Pten thereby contributing to EMT. We suggest that manipulating miR-494 expression may represent a novel approach to preventing EMT associated with CsA induced nephrotoxicity.},

   Abstract={A mechanism whereby water flow towards root surfaces is stimulated when exposed to nutrient patches may be evolutionarily desirable in environments with heterogeneous soils. Indeed, the presence of nitrate has been shown to increase root hydraulic conductance in a few agricultural species characterized by high nitrate demand. Does a similar stimulation of root conductivity in response to external nitrate addition exist among wild type organisms? To answer this question, we studied and compared the effect of a sudden increase of nitrate concentration on root hydraulic properties in seven species. These included three agricultural species ({\textit{Cucumis sativus} L., {\textit{Solanum esculentum} L., {\textit{Zea mays} L.) and four wild type species ({\textit{Arabidopsis thaliana} L., {\textit{Festuca arundinacea} Schreb., {\textit{Populus trichocarpa} Torr.&Gray, {\textit{Nephrolepis exaltata} L.). The selected species differed in overall nitrate demand and specific nitrate uptake rates. Changes in root hydraulic conductance induced by nitrate varied from non-existent (N. exaltata L.) to more than 50\% increases (Z. mays L.). The magnitude of the hydraulic response to nitrate presence was significantly correlated with species nitrate uptake rate. This finding suggests an emergent physiological trait that links together plant nitrate needs, nitrate availability and root hydraulic properties.}
